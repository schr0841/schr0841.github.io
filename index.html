        <h2>My Work in AI/ML/DS</h2> 

        <p>I'm a Python programmer with a passion for Artificial Intelligence. I contribute to the advancement of AI technology through my work with <a href="https://dataannotation.tech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dataannotation.tech</a>, 
            a platform specializing in evaluating and refining AI models. The projects involve a wide range of tasks, from reviewing AI-generated code and analyzing algorithms to transforming visual
             representations of neural networks into functional TensorFlow code. I play a crucial role in verifying the accuracy and performance of AI-generated games and physics simulators, and ensure 
             that generated graphs and charts accurately represent the data. I also work on more general projects related to chatbot functionality such as extracting key information, generating replies to 
             threads, rewriting text segments from a larger piece, andproviding general summarization while retaining context.  My core focus is on assessing and comparing different AI model outputs, 
             ensuring they meet the highest standards of truthfulness, groundedness, and correctness.</p> 

        <h3>Key Contributions</h3>
        <ul>
        <li><b>Code and Algorithm Analysis:</b> Reviewing AI-generated code, analyzing algorithms, converting visual representations of neural networks into working TensorFlow code, reverse-engineering plots in Matplotlib.</li>
        <li><b>Game and Simulator Verification:</b> Evaluating the performance and accuracy of AI-generated games and physics simulators.</li>
        <li><b>Chatbot Enhancement:</b> Analyzing chatbot performance in tasks such as extracting key information, generating email replies, and suggesting improvements to written content.</li>
        <li><b>Model Evaluation:</b> Assessing and comparing the quality of different AI model responses based on criteria such as truthfulness, groundedness, and correctness. (redundant)</li>

                <h3>U of M Bootcamp Final Project</h3>
                <p>This project aims to develop a Python predictive model for diabetes diagnosis using a dataset containing patient health metrics. It leverages machine learning techniques to predict with up to 97% accuracy the presence of diabetes based on various health indicators, 
                    including gender, age, hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, BMI, HbA1c levels, and blood glucose levels. My contributions included developing SVM and deep learning models, as well as advanced decision tree models.</p>

                <h3>Medical Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks</h3>
                <p>With colleague Christine J. We trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) model from scratch to classify CT chest scan images as either cancerous or normal, 
                    and then investigated the added benefit of using pre-trained CNN models on the same dataset by employing transfer learning. Furthermore, we investigated model 
                    ensembling in general and its potential benefits and drawbacks. </p>
